# Hello World! I'm Lucas :wink:

## :wave: About Me

My birth name is Lucas, but people usually call me by Luxks, Luscas or Luxcas, be free to choose what sounds better to you!

I am a lover of teamwork, technology and complex challenges. The perfect work environment for me is a place where I can connect with different people, with dynamic tasks that push my skills to the limit.

My basic personal characteristics are adaptability ♻️, focus 👨‍💻, empathy 🤗, creativity 💡, proactivity 🚀, fast learning 🏃‍♂️ and excellent communication 🙋‍♂️.

I am working as Frontend Voluntary Developer at [Fortini](https://fortini.org.br/) since October 2021, a non governamental organization that helps children through sports and worked at [Upnid](https://upnid.com/) for two months as Frontend Web Developer, a Startup 
focused on online payment processing which unfortunantely is in closing process.

Currently, I am searching for an opportuinty to work as iOS developer, after completing the Go!dev by Idwall training with 110 hours about Swift.
